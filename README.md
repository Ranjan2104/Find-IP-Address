# Find IP Address
 IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16. 254.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in CIDR notation by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., 192.168.
